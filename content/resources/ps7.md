description: This file contains 6 problems on state space sizes in trellises for RM
  codes, projection/subcode duality and state space duality, Trellis-oriented generator
  matrix for (16, 5, 8) RM code, minimum-span generators for convolutional codes,
  Trellis complexity of MDS codes, and the Wolf bound, Muder bounds on state and branch
  complexity profiles of (24,12,8) code.
