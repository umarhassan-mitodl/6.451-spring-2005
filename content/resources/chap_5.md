description: This resource contains notes on signal constellations for the AWGN channel,
  probability of decision error, performance analysis in the power-limited regime,
  orthogonal and related signal sets, performance in the bandwidth-limited regime,
  design of small signal constellations, and summary of performance analysis and coding
  gain.
